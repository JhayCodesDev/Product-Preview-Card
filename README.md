## Overview
The goal of this challenge was to build a clean and responsive product preview card component that closely matches the provided design.

In this solution, I applied:

Semantic HTML structure to improve accessibility and readability.

Container and sub-container classes to organize the layout and separate content clearly.

CSS styling for typography, colors, spacing, and visual hierarchy to replicate the design mockup accurately.

Responsive design using media queries to ensure the component displays well on smaller screens (down to 320px).

Consistent CSS organization for maintainability and easier updates.

This challenge was a valuable opportunity to practice structuring layouts with containers, applying responsive styling, and refining attention to detail when converting a visual design into code.

## My process
1. Setup

Downloaded the starter files and extracted them into a new project folder named product-preview-card-main.
Reviewed the provided design mockups and instructions to understand the project requirements and layout.

2. Structure

Built the HTML structure using semantic tags and organized containers for clear content separation:

A #container as the main wrapper for the component.

A #sub-container inside the container to hold content sections:

.con-one – used for the primary product image and heading.

.con-two – contains product details, including pricing and description.

An .attribution class used for credits and links.

This structure allowed for a clear hierarchy, making it easier to style and maintain.

3. Styling

Styled the body using Flexbox for alignment and layout control.

Added base styles for typography, colors, spacing, and containers.

Styled each section in order, including product image, heading, description, and pricing details.

Applied hover states for interactive effects on buttons or the card itself.

Styled the attribution section to match the overall component design.

4. Responsiveness

Used a desktop-first approach, designing for larger screens first.

Applied media queries to adjust widths, font sizes, and spacing for smaller screens (320px–767px).

Ensured the flex layout and hover states worked well on all device sizes.

5. Finishing Up

Cleaned up the CSS by grouping selectors logically.

Tested the component across different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and interactivity.

Wrote the README and prepared the project for deployment.
